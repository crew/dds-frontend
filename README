Setup
=====
Copy examples/frontend.cfg to ~/.dds (or point it to a config file with the -c
command line option).

Configure config.py with the location of your slide cache (by default it's ~/.dds/slides),
the jabber ID and password for the client, and the jabber ID for the server.

Make sure that slides are registered to your client's jabber ID on the server, or
of course, it won't receive any slides to display.
