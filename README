Python 2.4+
python-clutter >= 0.8
python-xmpp
python-dns
python-vobject
python-tz
python-gflags
python-lxml

Setup
=====
- Install the listed dependencies

- Install the frontend package by running::
      python setup.py install

- Copy the example configuration (examples/frontend.cfg) to ~/.dds. Configure
  frontend.cfg with the location of your slide cache (by default it's
  ~/.dds/slides), the jabber ID and password for the client, and the jabber ID
  for the server.

- Make sure that slides are registered to your client's jabber ID on the
  server. It won't receive slides to display otherwise.

Running
=======
To test individual slides, run dds.py (which should be in your path after
installing this package) with the --oneslide option and the full path of that
slide.

To run the frontend in a production environment, run runner.sh, which should
also be in your path. (More documentation to come..)
